		What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?
		<br><br><br>
		When I was fairly young my father showed me very basic HTML and CSS. Due to my young age I have forgotten it all though. 
		<br><br><br>
		Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
		<br><br><br>
		I built my portfolio from scratch. In hindsight I wish I had chosen a template but the past is the past. 
		<br><br><br>
		What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)
		<br><br><br>
		I did't find any of my portfolio creation difficult however the linking of pages was time consuming and very teetious. 
		<br><br><br>
		How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?
		<br><br><br>
		I think I have more respect for web devs now esspecialy in big companies with strict deadlines.
		<br><br><br>
		What would you recommend to future students taking this class?
		<br><br><br>
		I would highly recomend saving the W3 schools website as a shortcut. This website was a great refrence with lots of examples and easy explanations.
